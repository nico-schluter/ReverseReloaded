Namespace: adsk.core

Provides a set of arguments from a firing InputChangedEvent to a InputEventChangedEventHandler's notify callback method.

### [static] classType() -> string
Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property.

- **Returns** (string): Returns a string indicating the type of the object.
