# Surface
Namespace: adsk.core
Inherits: Base
Since: August 2014

Describes a two-dimensional topological, manifold in three-dimensional space. It is used as the underlying geometry for a BRepFace.

**Accessed from:** BRepFace.geometry, BRepFaceDefinition.surfaceGeometry

## Methods

### [static] classType() -> string
Static function that all classes support that returns the type of the class as a string. The returned string matches the string returned by the objectType property. For example if you have a reference to an object and you want to check if it's a SketchLine you can use myObject.objectType == fusion.SketchLine.classType().
- **Returns** (string): Returns a string indicating the type of the object.

### transformBy(matrix: Matrix3D) -> boolean
Updates this surface by transforming it with a given input matrix.
- **matrix** (Matrix3D): A 3D matrix that defines the transform to apply to the surface.
- **Returns** (boolean): Returns true if the transform was successful.

## Properties

### evaluator : SurfaceEvaluator [read-only]
Returns the surface evaluator.

### isValid : boolean [read-only]
Indicates if this object is still valid, i.e. hasn't been deleted or some other action done to invalidate the reference.

### objectType : string [read-only]
This property is supported by all objects in the API and returns a string that contains the full name (namespace::objecttype) describing the type of the object.

It's often useful to use this in combination with the classType method to see if an object is a certain type. For example: if obj.objectType == adsk.core.Point3D.classType():

### surfaceType : SurfaceTypes [read-only]
Returns the surface type.
